# Image Restoration on Occlude Human Faces

## What I did on this repository after forking.
* Made minor changes in complete.py. 
* Added Test images from Celeb-A.
* Ran the code on my laptop for Results.

**Note :** I have forked the repository from [bamos](https://github.com/bamos/dcgan-completion.tensorflow). I have used this repository to get an idea of how powerful GANs are in restoring human faces.

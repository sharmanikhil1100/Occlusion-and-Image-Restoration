# Image Restoration on Occlude Human Faces

Made minor changes in complete.py. 

Used this code for experimenting the DCGAN's in restoring human occluded faces.

**Note :** I have forked the repository from [bamos](https://github.com/bamos/dcgan-completion.tensorflow). I have used this repository to get an idea of how powerful GANs are in restoring human faces.
